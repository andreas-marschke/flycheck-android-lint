Flycheck support for android linting

** DISCLAIMER

This is not finished yet and may not work at all.

** About

This flycheck checker enables parsing and lint highlighting 
based on Androids own lint report results. It looks at =build/reports/lint-results.xml= by 
default but can be configured to look at a different relative path from the projects root dir.
